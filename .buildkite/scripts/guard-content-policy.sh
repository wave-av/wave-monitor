# guard-content-policy — GHA parity with public-repo-guard.yml step "content
# policy (WAVE trade-secret / internal-leak gate)": runs the VENDORED
# scripts/public-repo-guard/content-policy.sh (never fetched at run time).
#
# GUARD_PRIVATE_REPOS arrives via host injection by (pipeline, step key) on the
# fpc-isolated-secrets queue — it is confidential config (private repo names),
# so it must NOT be inlined in pipeline.yml or any committed file. Unset/empty
# FAILS CLOSED here: a Buildkite config error must never silently disable the
# blocking private-repo rule. (Local callers run the vendored
# scripts/public-repo-guard/content-policy.sh directly, where the rule stays
# optional — see README.md.)
#
# Chunking (T1/WAVE-27030): the host secrets channel caps each value at 512B
# (golden image MAX_SECRET), so Doppler wave/bkjobs carries the list as
# GUARD_PRIVATE_REPOS_01.._06 and the allowlist grants all six to this step
# key. A full GUARD_PRIVATE_REPOS (GHA org var, per-build proof injection)
# takes precedence when set; otherwise all six chunks must be present — a
# missing chunk fails closed, never silently narrows the rule.
#
# PR mode (WAVE-27678): pull-request builds do not receive the list. The
# non-secret WAVE_JOB_GUARD_PR=1 runs every content-policy rule except
# private-repo, and only when BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST is a positive integer
# (Buildkite's pull-request number) and none of GUARD_PRIVATE_REPOS or
# GUARD_PRIVATE_REPOS_01.._06 is set. The flag together with any of those
# names exits 2: that list is not part of a pull-request build, so both
# together means the job environment was overridden. The names are not
# cleared and the rule is not skipped. The same flag when
# BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST is empty, "false", or any other non-number fails
# closed (exit 2), so a default-branch build cannot drop the rule. With the
# flag unset, a missing list still fails closed. Any other non-empty flag
# value (0, true, " 1", ...) fails closed too; empty counts as unset.
# PR mode is not a private-name clearance: its log says the private-repo
# rule was NOT checked (WAVE-27678 follow-up M3).
#
# Trusted policy in PR mode (WAVE-28333 M1): the policy never runs from the
# pull-request checkout. This script fetches refs/heads/$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_DEFAULT_BRANCH
# (never BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH, which the PR author picks) and
# runs that branch's scripts/public-repo-guard/content-policy.sh and
# .guardignore against a copy of the pull-request tree, which is data only.
# Inline `# guard:allow` markers are ignored in PR mode: they are
# pull-request content and must not exempt pull-request lines. The copy's
# .ignore, .rgignore and .gitignore files (any depth) are deleted too
# (MF-W1), so the default branch's .guardignore is the only exclusion
# source. When the
# default branch's copy of THIS wrapper carries the trusted-runner marker
# below, the PR copy re-execs that copy (`--trusted-stage`) and does nothing
# else itself. A missing default branch, fetch failure, or missing policy on
# the default branch exits 2; there is no fallback to the PR copy of the
# policy. Bootstrap: until the default branch's wrapper has the marker, the
# PR copy of this wrapper runs the steps above itself (still with the
# default-branch policy and .guardignore). The entry script of any
# Buildkite step is checkout code (no-command-eval), so a pull request that
# edits .buildkite/ can still change this wrapper or drop the step; closing
# that needs a host-side anchor (README "Buildkite runbook").
#
# GHA apt-installs ripgrep when missing; FPC guests must not assume sudo/apt,
# so a missing rg fails closed with a clear message instead.
